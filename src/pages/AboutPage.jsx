        Kamdhenu Dairy is built on trust, tradition, and purity — inspired by

        business.

      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.8, marginBottom: 16 }}>
        From locally sourced fresh milk to trusted Mother Dairy products, we
        ensure quality, hygiene, and transparency at every step.

      <p style={{ lineHeight: 1.8 }}>
        We believe food is not just consumption — it is care, culture, and
        continuity.
